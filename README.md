# 🎮 Java Text-Based RPG

## 📌 Overview
A simple **terminal-based role-playing game** built in Java for our **Object-Oriented Programming 1 (OOP1)** subject.  
This is our **final project** for OOP1, started on **September 16, 2025** and **still ongoing**.  
The game demonstrates **OOP concepts** such as classes, objects, inheritance, and modular design.

⚠ **Note:** This project is in its **very early development stage**.  
It is **not ready to run or play yet** — core systems and features are still being built.
